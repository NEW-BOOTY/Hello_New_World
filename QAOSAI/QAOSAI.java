/**
 * The QAOS-AI program you've engineered is a powerful simulation of a highly advanced AI-driven 
 * operating system designed to showcase cutting-edge capabilities. Here’s a breakdown of what it can do, 
 * how it operates, and potential real-world applications or uses:
 * 
 * 1. What QAOS-AI Can Do
 * Simulate Quantum-Classical Computation: The QuantumResourceManager class manages both quantum-like 
 * and classical computations, making random adaptive decisions about which type of computation to 
 * perform for each task. This allows it to simulate task prioritization and adaptive processing in 
 * an advanced computing environment.
 * Enhance Security Autonomously: The AdaptiveSecurityEngine monitors real-time events, detects threats, 
 * and responds autonomously. It can log both secure and insecure events, quarantine threats, and display 
 * a log of detected issues for review.
 * Verify Identities with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): The DecentralizedIdentityManager provides a 
 * decentralized framework for identity verification, using a mock blockchain-like system that stores 
 * and verifies user identities. MFA is generated and checked for each user interaction, bolstering security.
 * Secure Data Transmission: The AutonomousApiFramework encrypts messages using AES and simulates secure 
 * data transmission to specified recipients. This is designed to ensure that sensitive information is 
 * securely processed and safely transmitted.
 * Log and Monitor System Performance: The PerformanceMonitor logs execution times for different components, 
 * enabling adaptive resource allocation and providing insights into performance bottlenecks.
 * 
 * 2. What QAOS-AI Will Do
 * Optimize Computation and Resource Use: QAOS-AI's QuantumResourceManager logs task performance and can 
 * adjust its resources based on previous computational outcomes. Over time, this allows the program to 
 * optimize resource allocation, improving processing efficiency.
 * Proactively Manage and Respond to Threats: Through the AdaptiveSecurityEngine, QAOS-AI continuously 
 * monitors events and autonomously manages threats. By storing security logs, it supports both real-time 
 * and post-event analysis, enhancing overall system security.
 * Strengthen Identity Security: By using the decentralized identity manager, QAOS-AI registers and verifies 
 * users through MFA. It protects user data and ensures secure user interactions, with security checks on each interaction.
 * Safeguard Data Transmission: The system ensures that sensitive data is encrypted before transmission, 
 * making it suitable for secure communications in environments where data confidentiality is paramount.
 * Evaluate and Optimize Performance: The PerformanceMonitor provides a real-time log of component execution 
 * times, enabling system administrators or developers to identify and rectify any performance issues.
 * 
 * 3. How QAOS-AI Can Be Used
 * Testing and Simulation for AI-driven OS Development: QAOS-AI could serve as a prototype for developing 
 * autonomous OS-level AI applications, especially in cybersecurity, decentralized systems, and secure data handling.
 * Cybersecurity Research and Development: With its Adaptive Security Engine and decentralized identity 
 * management, QAOS-AI can be used to test and validate adaptive security strategies, identity verification 
 * mechanisms, and threat response systems.
 * Quantum and Hybrid Computation Testing: As it simulates quantum and classical processing decisions, QAOS-AI 
 * can be used in research environments to experiment with task scheduling and adaptive resource management 
 * strategies that could benefit hybrid quantum-classical computing systems.
 * Secure Communication and Data Management: The system’s Autonomous API Framework ensures secure message 
 * transmission, making it a useful testbed for applications that require strict encryption and secure API communications.
 * MFA and Identity Verification Models: QAOS-AI’s decentralized identity and MFA system make it suitable 
 * for developing and testing user verification frameworks, especially for blockchain-like environments or secure identity systems.
 * 
 * Technical Uses and Applications
 * Embedded Systems for Critical Security Operations: QAOS-AI’s architecture could be embedded in systems 
 * that require autonomous threat detection and response, such as industrial or national security systems.
 * Decentralized Authentication and Access Control: The decentralized identity manager is useful for scenarios 
 * requiring robust user verification, such as secure access systems for sensitive environments (e.g., healthcare or finance).
 * Adaptive Computing Systems: QAOS-AI’s hybrid quantum-classical approach can inform adaptive resource 
 * management models in high-performance computing environments, where computational efficiency is critical.
 * Performance Logging for System Optimization: With its performance monitoring capabilities, QAOS-AI serves 
 * as an excellent framework for logging, analyzing, and optimizing application performance in diverse environments.
 * 
 * This single-page program is a complete ecosystem that simulates an advanced AI-driven OS, making it a flexible, 
 * adaptable prototype for security, data handling, and computation research and development.
