/**
 * The DUKEªٱ program is a sophisticated, multi-functional system designed to simulate advanced high-speed internet operations, enforce cutting-edge security principles, 
 * and integrate various advanced functionalities inspired by the CISSP security domains. Here's what it can do and what it will do:
 *
 * Capabilities (What It Can Do):
 *
 *     High-Speed Internet Simulation:
 *         Simulates a network connection at speeds of 402 Tbps.
 *         Periodically demonstrates data transfer capabilities.
 *
 *     Secure Data Encryption:
 *         Implements AES encryption for sensitive data.
 *         Handles encryption errors gracefully with logging and exception handling.
 *
 *     Secure File System Operations:
 *         Ensures secure access and management of file systems.
 *         Automatically creates and manages secure files for data storage.
 *
 *     Network Operations:
 *         Executes secure HTTP operations (e.g., retrieving data from websites).
 *         Logs and monitors responses to ensure proper operation.
 *
 *     Integrated CISSP Security Principles:
 *         Security and Risk Management: Maintains confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
 *         Asset Security: Ensures secure data classification, storage, and disposal.
 *         Security Architecture and Engineering: Adopts robust frameworks and physical/logical security integration.
 *         Communication and Network Security: Secures network protocols, firewalls, and data transmission.
 *         Identity and Access Management (IAM): Employs authentication, authorization, and identity federation.
 *         Security Assessment and Testing: Performs vulnerability analysis, penetration testing, and control evaluations.
 *         Security Operations: Provides incident response, disaster recovery, and threat monitoring.
 *         Software Development Security: Integrates secure coding and SDLC best practices.
 *
 *     Subsystem Integration and Management:
 *         Quantum Resource Management: Processes computational tasks with enhanced efficiency.
 *         Adaptive Security Engine: Monitors events, manages security incidents, and provides real-time threat assessments.
 *         Decentralized Identity Manager: Manages users, generates multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens, and verifies identities.
 *         Autonomous API Framework: Facilitates secure data exchanges and communication between modules.
 *         Performance Monitoring: Logs subsystem performance metrics for system analysis.
 *
 * Functionality (What It Will Do):
 *
 *     Authentication and User Verification:
 *         Uses Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) to authenticate users securely.
 *         Implements custom callback handlers for robust login procedures.
 *
 *     Error-Handling and Logging:
 *         Logs all significant events, errors, and system performance for transparency.
 *         Ensures graceful recovery from errors without disrupting operations.
 *
 *     Dynamic Threat Management:
 *         Monitors security events in real-time.
 *         Automatically mitigates detected threats and updates security logs.
 *
 *     Performance Optimization:
 *         Tracks execution time of key subsystems.
 *         Provides insights into system bottlenecks for optimization.
 *
 *     Comprehensive Data Security:
 *         Enforces access controls, encryption, and secure disposal policies.
 *         Ensures compliance with modern security frameworks and regulations.
 *
 *     Enhanced System Design Principles:
 *         Integrates modular design for ease of extension and maintainability.
 *         Supports advanced cryptographic and quantum computing paradigms.
 *
