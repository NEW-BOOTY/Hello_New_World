# Secure System Application

## Overview
This Java-based application implements secure systems using advanced cryptographic techniques and optimization algorithms. It includes support for the following:
- **DHKEM_X25519_HKDF_SHA256**: Key exchange mechanism.
- **AES_256_GCM**: Authenticated encryption for data confidentiality and integrity.
- **Twofish**: Block cipher encryption.
- **HKDF_SHA256**: Key derivation function.
- **Ant Lion Optimization Algorithm**: Optimization algorithm for potential advanced applications.

### Features
- **Modular Design**: Cryptographic methods and optimization are packaged into reusable components.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling for invalid inputs, cryptographic failures, and system errors.
- **Security Best Practices**: Uses secure random generators, authenticated encryption, and robust key derivation.

## Prerequisites
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
   - Ensure you have JDK 11 or later installed.
2. **BouncyCastle Library** (for Twofish encryption):
   - Download the BouncyCastle JAR file from [BouncyCastle.org](https://www.bouncycastle.org/).
   - Place it in the `lib/` directory.
3. **Build Tool**:
   - Optionally, use Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies and compile the project.
