/**
 * Overview of the ScreenLockBypasser Java Application
 * 
 * The Java code provided is intended for a ScreenLockBypasser application that aims to bypass screen locks 
 * on Android and iOS devices. It uses the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for interaction with Android devices, 
 * while the handling for iOS devices is noted but not fully implemented. Below is a detailed breakdown of 
 * the code structure, functionality, and key considerations.
 * 
 * Key Components of the Code
 * 
 * Imports
 * 
 * The code begins by importing necessary libraries, essential for working with ADB and utility operations 
 * in Java.
 * 
 * import com.android.ddmlib.*;
 * 
 * import java.util.*;
 * 
 * Main Class
 * 
 * The main class, ScreenLockBypasser, contains the entry point for the application:
 * 
 * public class ScreenLockBypasser {
 * 
 *     public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
 * 
 *         // Connect to the Android device
 * 
 *         ...
 * 
 *     }
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * Connecting to the Android Device
 * 
 * The connection to the Android device is established using the AndroidDebugBridge.createBridge() method, 
 * connecting to a specified local IP address and port.
 * 
 * AndroidDebugBridge adb = AndroidDebugBridge.createBridge(
 * 
 *         "127.0.0.1:5037", // Change to the IP and port of the device
 * 
 *         false // Do not install an app
 * 
 * );
 * 
 * adb.addDevice(/* Device object */); // Add the connected device
 * 
 * bypassAndroidScreenLock(adb);
 * 
 * The placeholder for adding a connected device should be filled with a valid Device object representative 
 * of the connected Android device.
 * 
 * Bypassing Android Screen Lock
 * 
 * The method bypassAndroidScreenLock(AndroidDebugBridge adb) is responsible for bypassing the screen lock 
 * on an Android device. It first verifies if the device is online and then executes commands to alter the 
 * settings in the SQLite database related to the lock pattern.
 * 
 * private static void bypassAndroidScreenLock(AndroidDebugBridge adb) throws Exception {
 * 
 *     IDevice device = adb.getDevices().get(0); // Get the first device
 * 
 *     if (!device.isOnline()) {
 * 
 *         throw new Exception("Device is not online");
 * 
 *     }
 * 
 *     if (device.getState() != IDevice.STATE_ONLINE) {
 * 
 *         throw new Exception("Device is not in online state");
 * 
 *     }
 * 
 *     // Bypass the screen lock
 * 
 *     DeviceShell shell = device.getShell();
 * 
 *     shell.execute("sqlite3 /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/settings.db \"update system set value=0 where name='lock_pattern_autolock';\"");
 * 
 *     shell.execute("reboot");
 * 
 *     // Wait for the device to reboot
 * 
 *     Thread.sleep(30000); // 30 seconds
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * The code retrieves the first connected device and validates its online status.
 * 
 * It utilizes shell commands to update the lock settings in the device's database and performs a reboot of the device.
 * 
 * iOS Screen Lock Bypass
 * 
 * For the iOS device, the method bypassIosScreenLock(/* iOS device object */) is mentioned but lacks 
 * implementation. It is noted that the bypassing of the screen lock assumes the device is jailbroken, which 
 * is significant for ethical considerations.
 * 
 * private static void bypassIosScreenLock(/* iOS device object */) {
 * 
 *     // Example: Bypassing screen lock on a jailbroken iOS device
 * 
 *     // This method assumes the iOS device is jailbroken, which is against Apple's terms of service
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * The comment indicates that a specific command would execute on the iOS device if it were jailbroken.
 * 
 * Key Considerations
 * 
 * Legal and Ethical Implications: Bypassing device locks generally violates terms of service and can be 
 * illegal. This code should only be used in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and with 
 * explicit permission from the device owner.
 * 
 * Error Handling: The implementation of error handling could be improved, particularly around shell command 
 * execution and device connection processes.
 * 
 * Device Selection: The current implementation fetches only the first device connected. It might be 
 * beneficial to allow the user to select a specific device if multiple devices are connected.
 * 
 * Conclusion
 * 
 * The ScreenLockBypasser application provides foundational logic for bypassing screen locks on Android devices 
 * using ADB while indicating a potential path for handling iOS devices.
