/**
 * This program demonstrates a technique called "trust all certificates," where a custom trust manager is installed that trusts all SSL certificates, regardless of their validity.
 * This method bypasses the security mechanisms provided by SSL/TLS and allows access to encrypted communications.
 * Additionally, an all-trusting host name verifier is installed to bypass host name verification during the SSL handshake process.
 * 
 * Remember that this technique should only be used in controlled environments and should not be applied in production systems, as it severely weakens the security of the network and the application.
 * This is a conceptual representation of a single-page program that demonstrates techniques for bypassing encryption protocols like SSL/TLS.
 * This program should be used only for ethical and legal purposes, such as security research or penetration testing.
 * The code provided may require additional adjustments based on specific requirements and the network environment.
