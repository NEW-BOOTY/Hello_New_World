/*
 * How This Program Works:
 * =======================
 *
 * Main Class (SystemSimulation):
 * - The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing and executing the simulation.
 * - Calls startSimulation() to manage loading configurations, setting up services, and running the simulation workflow.
 *
 * Service Manager (ServiceManager):
 * - Coordinates and orchestrates the different services (ReplicationService, SimulationService, MimicService, MockService).
 * - Sets up and sequentially runs these services to simulate system operations.
 *
 * Services:
 * ---------
 * 1. Replication Service:
 *    - Simulates data replication between different systems or nodes.
 *
 * 2. Simulation Service:
 *    - Handles the simulation of complex operations or processes within the system.
 *
 * 3. Mimic Service:
 *    - Emulates real-world system behaviors, including interactions with external systems.
 *
 * 4. Mock Service:
 *    - Simulates external systems, allowing testing of the system’s behavior without relying on real external dependencies.
 *
 * Configuration Loader (ConfigLoader):
 * - Responsible for loading configuration settings from a .properties file.
 * - Enables dynamic control of simulation settings without altering the source code.
 *
 * Logger:
 * - Provides a logging mechanism that includes timestamps for traceability.
 * - Tracks and logs every major step and activity during the simulation.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * =============
 *
 * 1. Realistic Simulation:
 *    - Simulates real-world systems via MimicService and complex processes via SimulationService.
 *    - Includes data replication functionality through ReplicationService.
 *
 * 2. Modular Services:
 *    - Services are modular and interchangeable, enabling flexibility and customization for different requirements.
 *    - Each service can be extended or replaced to match specific simulation scenarios.
 *
 * 3. Logging:
 *    - Logs all activities with timestamps, ensuring a detailed trace of the simulation’s execution.
 *    - Useful for debugging, auditing, and analyzing system behavior.
 *
 * 4. Configuration Management:
 *    - Uses an external configuration file (config.properties) to manage simulation settings dynamically.
 *    - Simplifies modifications and reduces dependency on hardcoded values.
 *
 * 5. Error Handling:
 *    - Handles errors related to configuration loading gracefully by logging descriptive error messages.
 *    - Logs activities and exceptions for debugging and ensuring robustness.
 *
 * What the Program Does:
 * ======================
 *
 * 1. Initialization:
 *    - Loads a configuration file and initializes all necessary services.
 *
 * 2. Simulation Execution:
 *    - Runs services to simulate data replication, process execution, external system interactions, and real-world behaviors.
 *
 * 3. Logging:
 *    - Tracks and records each significant step of the simulation for traceability.
 *
 * Possible Use Cases:
 * ===================
 *
 * 1. System Testing:
 *    - Simulates system behavior in controlled environments for testing interactions with external systems or processes.
 *
 * 2. Prototyping and Development:
 *    - Provides a framework for prototyping features and studying component interactions in a service-based architecture.
 *
 * 3. Educational Purposes:
 *    - Demonstrates service-based architectural principles and system interactions effectively.
 *
 * 4. Data Replication Testing:
 *    - Tests distributed database replication or cloud storage solutions to ensure robustness and reliability.
 *
 * Summary:
 * ========
 * - This program offers a robust framework for simulating complex system interactions.
 * - It supports real-world service mimicking, modular architecture, configuration management, and detailed logging.
 * - A versatile base for expanding into more sophisticated simulation and testing systems.
