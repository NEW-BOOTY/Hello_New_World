/**
 * Enhanced Features in the Program
 *
 * <p>Vulnerability Identification: - Devices have a isVulnerable attribute to simulate real-world
 * security flaws. - Worm exploits vulnerabilities to spread, emphasizing the importance of securing
 * systems.
 *
 * <p>Activity Logging: - Every infection attempt and success is logged for tracking, which aligns
 * with ethical penetration testing practices. - Example log: "INFECTED: Device exploited due to
 * vulnerability."
 *
 * <p>Randomized Network Security: - Devices in the simulated network have randomized security
 * levels (vulnerable or secure). - Demonstrates how unsecured systems can compromise entire
 * networks.
 *
 * <p>Educational Focus: - Illustrates the propagation of worms, emphasizing the need for patching
 * vulnerabilities. - Does not interact with real systems, ensuring ethical usage.
 *
 * <p>Safe Network Visualization: - Final network status highlights infected, vulnerable, and secure
 * devices, teaching about infection containment and the impact of vulnerabilities.
 *
 * <p>How It Works: Initialization: - A simulated network of 10 devices is created. - Each device is
 * randomly assigned as "Vulnerable" or "Secure."
 *
 * <p>Worm Infection Process: - Starts with one infected device. - Worm scans the network and
 * infects vulnerable devices using random probabilities.
 *
 * <p>End of Simulation: - Once no further infections can occur, the simulation stops. - The program
 * outputs the final status of all devices.
 *
 * <p>Real-World Applications: - Network Security Training: Demonstrates the risks of unpatched
 * systems and vulnerable configurations. - Awareness Campaigns: Highlights how worms spread and the
 * importance of strong cybersecurity practices. - Penetration Testing Basics: Introduces the
 * concept of testing network defenses in a controlled environment.
