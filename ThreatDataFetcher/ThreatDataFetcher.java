/*
 * What the Program Will Do:
 * =========================
 * 
 * 1. Simulate Fetching Threat Data:
 *    - The program simulates making HTTP requests to real-world threat intelligence services:
 *      - VirusTotal for file hash checks.
 *      - IBM X-Force Exchange for URL analysis.
 *      - ThreatMiner for IP address analysis.
 *    - It uses API keys for authentication and constructs requests to fetch threat data about specific files, URLs, and IP addresses.
 *    - While actual responses are simulated (mock data), the structure can be extended to interact with real APIs using valid API keys.
 * 
 * 2. Fetch Threat Information:
 *    - VirusTotal: Simulates fetching threat data for a file hash, providing information on whether the file is flagged as malicious.
 *    - IBM X-Force Exchange: Simulates fetching URL information, checking for associations with phishing or malware.
 *    - ThreatMiner: Simulates fetching IP data, including associated threats like DDoS attacks or botnets.
 * 
 * 3. Simulate API Responses:
 *    - Parses and prints simulated JSON responses from each service.
 *    - Example outputs include malicious flags, scan dates, and threat categories.
 * 
 * 4. Display Output:
 *    - Structured output is displayed for each fetched threat data, mimicking real API call results.
 * 
 * What the Program Can Do:
 * =========================
 * 
 * 1. Simulate Interaction with Threat Intelligence APIs:
 *    - Mimics querying files, URLs, and IPs for threat data:
 *      - Simulated requests to VirusTotal for file hash analysis.
 *      - Simulated requests to IBM X-Force Exchange for URL analysis.
 *      - Simulated requests to ThreatMiner for IP address analysis.
 * 
 * 2. Authenticate via API Keys:
 *    - Simulated API requests use API keys for authentication (placeholders can be replaced with real keys).
 * 
 * 3. Parse and Print JSON Responses:
 *    - Parses HTTP request responses and prints simulated threat data, aiding in security risk analysis.
 * 
 * 4. Mock Real-Time Threat Analysis:
 *    - Simulates outcomes from threat intelligence providers, such as:
 *      - Flagging files as malicious or suspicious.
 *      - Identifying URLs linked to phishing or malware.
 *      - Highlighting IPs tied to known threats like DDoS or botnets.
 * 
 * What the Program Can Be Used For:
 * =================================
 * 
 * 1. Threat Intelligence Data Fetching Simulation:
 *    - Simulates querying VirusTotal, IBM X-Force, and ThreatMiner for files, URLs, and IPs.
 *    - Provides a foundation for tools to fetch real-time data for security analysis.
 * 
 * 2. Threat Intelligence Integration:
 *    - Extendable to integrate real-world APIs for enhanced security systems.
 *    - Helps create security monitoring systems fetching real-time threat data.
 * 
 * 3. Security Automation and Incident Response:
 *    - Automates querying threat intelligence platforms during investigations.
 *    - Rapidly provides insights on files, URLs, and IPs during security incidents.
 * 
 * 4. Research and Learning:
 *    - Ideal for developers and researchers to understand API integration in security contexts.
 *    - Facilitates experimenting with various API responses and scenarios.
 * 
 * 5. Develop Threat Intelligence Dashboards:
 *    - Can populate security dashboards with real-time analysis of files, URLs, and IPs.
 *    - Expandable into a comprehensive security application.
 * 
 * 6. Prototyping Security Applications:
 *    - Quick prototype for fetching and processing threat data for larger systems.
 * 
 * Use Case Example:
 * =================
 * 
 * - Imagine a Security Operations Center (SOC) team needs to assess a suspicious file hash, URL, or IP address flagged during an investigation:
 *   - The SOC queries VirusTotal for file hashes to check for malware flags.
 *   - IBM X-Force Exchange is queried for phishing or malware associations with the URL.
 *   - ThreatMiner is used to evaluate if an IP address is linked to a botnet or DDoS attacks.
 * - The results help the SOC decide whether to investigate further or block the file/URL/IP in network defenses.
 * 
 * Summary of Key Features and Benefits:
 * =====================================
 * 
 * 1. Simulated threat intelligence fetching from well-known providers.
 * 2. Simple API interaction, easily extendable for real use.
 * 3. Mocked data parsing to visualize threat information retrieval and processing.
 * 4. Real-world applications in security monitoring, automation, and threat analysis.
 * 5. Learning and prototyping tool for developers and researchers.
 * 
 * The program serves as a foundational framework for integrating, processing, and simulating real-time threat data in security systems.
